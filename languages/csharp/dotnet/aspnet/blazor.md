# Experimental .NET based WebAssembly Framework

## Definition

Blazor is a single page web app framework built on .NET that runs in the browser via WebAssembly.

## What is about?
Running .NET in the browser is made possible by a relatively new standardized web technology called WebAssembly. WebAssembly is a "portable, size- and load-time-efficient format suitable for compilation to the web." Code compiled to WebAssembly can run in any browser at native speeds. To run .NET binaries in a web browser we use a .NET runtime (specifically Mono) that has been compiled to WebAssembly.
