## CSS GridLayout

Since we introduced grid structure in pages with CSS, javascript and float. With new specification we will easily adapt grid layout without external libraries

CSS is the preferred choice for laying out web pages, even when it did not provide much explicit support for creating layouts. Flexbox helped with simpler, one-dimensional layouts, but developers usually reached for libraries and toolkits for more complex layouts. CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that provides a mechanism to divide available space for layout into columns and rows using a set of predictable sizing behaviors. Grid does not require any libraries and plays well with Flexbox and other CSS display elements. However, since IE11 is only partially supported, it ignores users who still depend on a Microsoft browser on Windows 7.
